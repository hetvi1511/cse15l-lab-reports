# Lab Report 4


This week we had a very different Lab session compared to the previous ones. We had a competition environment setup. They gave us a task in the 
starting of the lab session and gave us 1 hour to prepare for those tasks. Then we had to compete with each other, whoever did it the fastest proceeded 
to the next round and finally a winner would be announced.\
The steps we were asked to do were as follows:\
> 1. Setup Delete any existing forks of the repository you have on your account
2. Setup Fork the repository
3. The real deal Start the timer!
4. Log into ieng6
5. Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account
6. Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
7. Edit the code file to fix the failing test
8. Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
9. Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account (you can pick any commit message!)
